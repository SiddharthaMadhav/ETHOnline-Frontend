# SureBuy
SureBuy is a decentralized verified marketplace where sellers are authorized to list products. Sellers can request attestation from wholesalers, who verify the product's authenticity using Sign Protocol.
## Project Description
In today’s digital economy, trust is paramount in online marketplaces. Buyers frequently encounter the risk of purchasing counterfeit or unauthorized products, leading to significant concerns about product authenticity. Many platforms allow vendors to sell items under a manufacturer’s name, yet these vendors may not be authorized to do so, often offering duplicate products that do not originate from the manufacturer. This project seeks to revolutionize the online marketplace by creating a secure platform where sellers can only offer products that have been verified and attested by the respective manufacturers. By implementing a robust attestation system, we aim to eliminate unauthorized vendors and ensure that all products listed in the marketplace are 100% authentic and authorized. Vendors must obtain attestation from manufacturers before listing their products. This ensures that only authorized sellers can market items under a manufacturer’s name. Vendors can submit requests for attestation to multiple manufacturers. Manufacturers have the authority to accept or decline these requests, maintaining control over their brand’s representation. The attestation process is facilitated by leveraging the Sign Protocol, which allows for on-chain verification of seller attestations. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for a central authority, significantly reducing the risk of fraud and manipulation. By uniting buyers, vendors, and manufacturers on a single, trustworthy platform, this project aims to redefine the online shopping experience. With a focus on authenticity and security, we are committed to creating a marketplace where trust is not just an option, but a guarantee.
